## Our Project Scope

The aim of our project is to create a web application that will allow students to connect with eachother through an online platform to find study peers. We have decided to create a web application "Study Buddy", when a student first goes onto Study Buddy, they will need to create an account, and then add there papers. This will store there papers againts their profile in a database. Students will then be able to connect with their peers, by using the search function that we implemented. The search function will return other students name and email address that are taking the same paper. Giving the student the ability to email their peers to set up study sessions. We have also implemented a chat room feature, where students can join a group chat which is identified by a chat id e.g. "INFO310". 

## How to use Study Buddy

1. Create an account: Once you have created an account, fill out the form on the "Sign up" tab. You will then be redirected to the log in page and need to fill in your username and password. 
2. Add Papers: Go to the "Add Papers" tab and add the papers you are studying, there is format checking. For example "BSNS114" or "INFO303".
3. Redirect yourself to the dropdown menu, and "Account Info" to add/update your major.
4. Next redirect yourself to the "Find Study Peers" page and search the paper that you are wanting to use to find other study peers in.
5. A list will be populated with other students that are doing the same paper. 

### Entering a chat room 

1. First to enter a chat room you will need to navigate to the "Inbox" page. Click "Create Chatroom", and enter in a chatroom name, this will become the chat room id. 
2. Share your chatroom id with peers, or if you enter a generic chatroom like "INFO303" you will be added to the chatroom if it already exisits.
